"Do what you can to make people feel great when they use your stuff" - that is what every UX designer wants to achieve

### Motivation
There are many social challenges in Singapore today such as charity mobility and disadvantaged sectors and no, donation will be sustainable in a long run. Hence, charities organisation have to find a way to sustain itself rather than relying on monetary donation.

### Current Solution
One of the ways to sustain themselves is through upcycling. Charities organisation conducted programmes in upcycling items and sell the items to the public. However, it is not as sustainable as it would due to various factors.

### Current Practice of Upcycle and Recycle Campaign
Before I dive into the problems of upcycle and recycling. Let's look at the current practice for local charities. they organize the upcycle and recycle campaigns and give out leaflets to households in specific areas. Then they will assign Karang Guni to collect the donated items. The Karang Guni will send the collected items to charities for uprecycle purpose or they will sell to recycling companies and part of the proceeds will go to the charity.

### Problems faced by Charities and Volunteers
However, the current process is not efficient as there are problems faced by the Volunteers who helped out with collecting donated items for the respective charity organisations too.
#### 1. Door to Door inefficiency
Volunteers tend to go door to door to ask for donations without knowing who is in or who has items to donate to them. Often, there is a high chance that no one is at home or they do not have any items to donate. This can result in a waste of time and effort for the collectors.
#### 2. Timing mismatch
Generally when there is a Donation collection campaign organised, leaflets will be distributed to households. Information such as the timing of collection, collection point, description of the campaign, police licence are displayed on the leaflet. However, there could be a timing mismatch with the potential donors as there have plans ahead. Although donors can leave their donated items outside their household, this does not ensure that their donated items will be collected by the Volunteers due to various factors - left out accidentally, not enough manpower, etc
#### 3. Inefficient allocation of manpower
Generally, volunteers are being distributed into different sectors of the collected area to collect items. However, the supply of donations by donors cannot be known beforehand in determining the distribution of volunteers into the various sectors. Hence, there could be an inefficient allocation of manpower.
#### 4. Manpower needed to sort items (or dispose too...)
Many of the volunteers do not know what should be disposed or donated, resulting in the additional manpower needed to sort items into the appropriate categories before determining what can be sold or used. 

### Problems faced by the potential donors

#### 1. No flexible timing available

#### 2. Unsure whether the items is in a "donatable" state


#### Hypothesis Statement
Now that we have defined the problems and we have a clear idea of who our users are, we use a method to generate ideas on how to design a product that will help uesers accomplish their goals

​
#### Key features
1. Onboarding
2. Donation process
3. Volunteering
4. Campaigns
